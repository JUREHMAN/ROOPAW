# ROOPAW
Basic ROOPAW scripts
ROOPAW is an elegant extension of PYROOT which we can use for plotting from the .root files.
This repository is about the simple scripts used for plotting from the root files.
In case of using these scripts, file names, tree names and variable names should be adjusted according to the root files at hand.
